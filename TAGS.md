- not-good-enough - old version, too generic, too similar to everything else, it
  will be submerged by the sheer amount of other similar ideas. Why even bother

  already. Revolutionary? Maybe this should be our choice, the revolution. The
  risks are high and it can fail. But this is the only way. We need a bit of
  luck, that's all.

* Now

  A set of minimal features which makes the editor usable, but not necessarily
  pleasant to use.

** TODO Modal editing, convenient key bindings
** TODO Swappable frontends, client-server architecture

* Some time later

  All of it would be nice, but let's grow steadily.

** TODO Integrations with external tools
** TODO Syntax highlighting
** TODO Multiple cursors
** TODO Multiple panes/tabs
** TODO Clipboard integration
** TODO Autocompletion
** TODO File finder
** TODO Jump inside file to functions, variables etc.
** TODO Mouse integration
** TODO Language Server Protocol (LSP)

* Probably never

  These are the features which are almost certainly not part of a standard editing experience.
  But nevertheless they can be considered given a solid use case. It is also advisable to
  not make hard assumptions which would block these features from being implemented forever.
  
** Non-UTF8 encodings
** Edit binaries/hexeditor
** Edit large files like gigabytes of csv
